- attribution to city of toronto in api and app
- come up with very simple api (returns Monday, Tuesday)
- future version, think of internationalization
- api is get based (longitude, latitude)
- http://toronto.garbage-day.com/api/v0.1?longitude=-74&latitude=10
- response: Monday
- response: cache for a Month!
- internal beta: for friends, it only supports toronto
- vancouver
- montreal
- future versions: major canadian cities
- new york
- major us cities (when possible)
- version 0.1, just print out the day
- version 0.2, center the map, show the day as an overlay
- version x, add multiple layers (mmm no!, people won't be able to find the app)
- version x, maybe it could show other points of interest in the map

THOUGHTS
--------
- when say sending a tweet to instapaper, your u-shadow knows where the instapaper item came from. So, marking something as favourite in instataper should also mark it fovourite in twitter.
